collection: publications
category: manuscripts
permalink: /publication/CCML
excerpt: 'In our paper, we explore the intersection of provable leakage resilience and context-commitment security in authenticated encryption schemes. We introduce two blueprints: one based on Encrypt-then-MAC (EtM) and another single-pass framework using leveled implementations. By carefully selecting underlying primitives, such as using identical keys for encryption and authentication along with a collision-resistant PRF as the MAC, we ensure these blueprints are committing. Our work provides a foundation for proving the security of several state-of-the-art schemes, including TEDT, TEDT2, Romulus-T, and Triplex. **Accepted to Fast Software Encryption (FSE) 2025**.'
