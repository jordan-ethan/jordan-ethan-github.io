excerpt: 'In our paper, we introduce CTET+, a 2-round tweakable substitution-permutation network (SPN) using a single secret S-box and independent round keys, achieving beyond-birthday-bound security. CTET+ encrypts ωκ-bit messages with 5n + κ-bit keys and n-bit tweaks, offering 2^(2n/3)-bit security while maintaining efficiency comparable to AES-XTS, EME, XCB, and TET. We also propose AES_6-CTET+, an instantiation using a reduced round AES block cipher, demonstrating 127-bit security. This scheme is ideal for disk encryption and cloud storage, where enhanced security is crucial. **Presented at Fast Software Encryption (FSE) 2022**.'
