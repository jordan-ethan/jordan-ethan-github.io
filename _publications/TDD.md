collection: publications

permalink: /publication/TEML
excerpt: 'In this paper, we provide the first analysis of the Iterated Tweakable Even-Mansour cipher (TEML) with linear tweak and key (tweakey) mixing. TEML captures the high-level design of many tweakable block ciphers, including SKINNY, Deoxys, TweGIFT, and TweAES, from a provable security standpoint. We extend previous research by proposing a class of linear tweakey schedules to absorb tweak(ey) material efficiently and offering a rigorous security treatment for r-round TEML. Our work enhances the provable security foundation for the TWEAKEY framework, contributing to the field of cryptographic security proofs. **Presented at Fast Software Encryption (FSE) 2024**.'
